Red Room
--------
-In this room it acts like a tutorial where you can have a feel of what kind of puzzles will there be.
-The first section of the room there will only be a single seesaw and a single crate to let the player feel familiraized with the seesaw mechanic.
-There is a metal crate that the player needs to change to wood. Then bring the wood to the other end of the see saw, and change it back to metal.
-The other end will be lifted up, which allows the player to proceed and jump up to enter into the next area. 

-The second section of this room will be a single torch and wooden bar surrounding the pressure plate.
-The player will first change the metal bar cage to wooden cage. Player proceeds to the opposite end of the pit, and change the metal crate to wood.
-Player will then carry the wood crate to the pit area, and proceed on to get the torch. 
-Player then uses the fire torch to burn the wooden bars. 
-The Wooden crate will through into the pit.
-The player then proceeds to change the wood crate to metal, in order to apply pressure onto the pressure plate within the pit itself.
-The exit door will open, and player proceeds to exit the red room.

-The third section will be a combination of both the first and second section. 
-The player will see a metal crate, he will change it into the wood, and carries it and place it onto the first pressure plate, the door will lift up slightly. 
-Player sees a metal crate within the metal bars, he will proceed to convert the metal bars to wood, and then proceed to the far end of section, where he'll see a torch on a pressure plate.
-The player will then proceed onto the far end of the section, where he'll see a torch on a pressure plate.
-He'll pick up the torch, and proceed to the wooden cage again, burn the cage, and change the metal crate to wood. 
-After that is done, he will then proceed to bring the wood crate to the 2nd pressure plate area, and place the wood crate down
-The player will then change the wood crate to metal, in order to apply pressure onto it, which lifts the door slightly even up.
-After that's done, player will go for the see saw with a metal crate on top. 
-Upon reaching there, he will change the metal crate to wood, and proceeds to bring it to the 3rd pressure plate area. He will then drop it onto the pressure plate.
-This causes the door to lift up fully, which allows the player to leave the section. 


White Room
----------
-In this room metal bars are introduced specifically to block playerâ€™s path, player needs to change the material properties of Metal bars into Wood.
-Once the material has changed into wood the player needs to pick up a torch and burn down the wooden bars.
-In the room we introduce a new puzzle where the player has to activate 3 different pressure plates in sequence to open the door.
-There would be subtle hints for the player to know which crate to hit first.
-The first crate to be pushed onto the pressure plate would be indicated SINGLE-LAMP hang on the wall near the pressure plate, followed by the DOUBLE-LAMP pressure plate, and lastly would be the TRIPLE-LAMP pressure plate. If the player gets any of the order wrong, the door will not open.
-When the player enters the room there will be a wooden box to the left, the player has to take the wooden box to the seesaw that is in front of the player on the opposite end of the room.
-Once there the player has to go up the seesaw and grab the torch that is on top of the pressure plate.
-When the player has the torch he is supposed to walk up the stairs, drop the torch on the floor and change the metal bar into a wooden bar, pick up the torch again and burn down the wooden bar to get the second crate.
-Once the wooden bar is burned down, take the second block to the second seesaw and get the third crate that is elevated.
The player now has to bring the third crate to the SINGLE-LAMP pressure plate, the second crate that is on the second seesaw and put the crate on the DOUBLE-LAMP pressure that where the torch used to be.
-Lastly the player has to take the first crate to the TRIPLE-LAMP pressure plate to finally open the door.
